# Plateau

Experimental file system based on tags instead of directories.

- You can _cd_ into tags like directories
- Implicit directories are created based on combinations of tags, eg. 'images' and 'work' implicitly create 'images-work'
- A file can belong to one or more tags, and if it no longer belongs to a tag, it belongs to the .trash tag
- The line between searches and tags is blurred, eg. 'recent files' or 'vector images' can be tags

Prototype, mainly for getting a feel for the UX. I'm also planning to build a GUI.
